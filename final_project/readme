model_result: Contains some of the saved results from the model runs. Since some were run on the server, some of them do not display model.summary().
each_epochs_loss: Saved in the format: Epoch, Avg Loss, Avg MSE Loss, Validation Loss.
model file and model_keras_save file are the types of models I tried to save. The model_keras_save model was too large, so I have already deleted it.
The code includes the models I tried: Autoencoder model, Vision Transformer model, and ResNet + Autoencoder.
Among these, ResNet + Autoencoder performed the best. You can run my ProteinStructurePredictor7(), where the parameters are still being modified and adjusted, so the current loss may not be in the optimal state.
