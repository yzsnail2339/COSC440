Q1: Is there anything we need to know to get your code to work? If you did not get your code working or handed in an incomplete solution please let us know what you did complete (0-4 sentences)
    no

Q2: Consider the three following 23x23 images of the digit 3.
Which neural net is better suited for identifying the digit in each image: a convolutional neural net or a feed-forward (multi-layer linear+ReLU) neural network? Explain your reasoning. (2-3 sentences)
    picture2,convolutional neural net is better, because translation invariance and when the image is in the center, the convolutional kernel will cover it more times.
Q3: Consider the dataset shown in this scatterplot:
The orange points are labeled with class label 0, and the blue points are labeled with class label 1. Write out a mathematical expression in terms of the inputs, using linear layers and ReLUs, that will correctly classify all of these points. We expect something like output = .. as many expressions/nested expressions as you need.. where an expression can include a literal number such as 3.4, calls to relu(...), x1, x2, and +, *, and > operators. For example, this expression does not work but does follow the expected format:
output = 2 * relu(x1) + relu(x1 + x2) > 1
Hint: Use https://tinyurl.com/y5gayl5b and with your mouse hover over the bias/weight edges.
    output1 = 2.8 * relu(x1) - 0.84 * relu(x2)  - 3 * relu(x1 + x2) > 1
    output2 = 0.8 * relu(x1) - 1.2 * relu(x2)  + 4.4 * relu(x1 + x2) > 1
    output3 = - 0.95 * relu(x1) - 2.8 * relu(x2)  - 3 * relu(x1 + x2) > 1
    output = linear(output1, output2, output3)

Q4: Read about this algorithm, which claims to predict “criminality” based on people’s faces, and was created by researchers in China. (If interested, you can click through to the arxiv link where the researchers publish a response to criticism & media about their original paper).
  (a) What factors do the researchers claim contribute to “criminality?” (1-3 sentences)
  (b) What’s one potential confounding variable/feature that their algorithm learned? What’s your evaluation of the “effectiveness” of this algorithm? (2-4 sentences)
  (c) If this algorithm were actually deployed, what are the consequences of this algorithm making a mistake (misclassification)? (1-3 sentences)
(a)criminals were “throwbacks” more closely related to apes than law-abiding citizens.
(b)curvature of upper lip,distance between two inner corners of the eyes,the angle between two lines drawn from the tip of the nose to the corners of the mouth.The algorithm's robustness is not high, and the dataset is too small. Additionally, it was trained on a specific population from a particular country and time period. As time progresses, humans may continue to evolve and change.
(c)It could damage the reputation of innocent people, and if a criminal is mistakenly identified as non-criminal, it could mislead the police.
